# Students_Valuation
Replication files for "Estimating Students' Valuation for College Experiences"

To replicate all tables/figures in the paper run the code/main.do file with desired tables/figures selected. 

Some tables/figures require restricted data.

The code blocks "setup_indiv_est", "shrunk_indiv_est", and "setup_validation" should be run before the other blocks.

Tables/Figures were compiled using Stata 18 on a macOS M1 laptop.
